# Handoff – 2025-11-17

## Summary
- Delivered an alert management surface inside Trader Defaults: lists every saved rule, allows inline threshold/channel edits, pause/resume, delete, and shows the last fired timestamp plus recent delivery events so support can debug from a single pane.
- Alert composer now broadcasts a `fi-alert-created` event so the manager auto-refreshes; `/api/alerts` supports GET/PATCH/DELETE with strict channel/status guards, and new server helper `getAlerts` feeds the SSR flow.
- Added `AlertManager` Vitest coverage alongside TypeScript models and Supabase service fetcher to keep the new UI under test.
- Dashboard header wiring passes alert metadata into Onboarding so users immediately see saved rules + activity without leaving the modal, while right-rail history keeps working unchanged.

## Next Steps
1. Wire SendGrid + Telegram API keys into the alert worker/container so the new CRUD flow can dispatch real messages instead of stubs.
2. Run fetchers with the São Paulo proxy env vars set (`BINANCE_PROXY_URL`, `BYBIT_PROXY_URL`, headers) to backfill Binance/Bybit data for the analytics components before polishing heatmap/mobile work.
3. Extend the new alert manager with rule cloning or bulk pause once real beta data surfaces, and expose alert events on a dedicated page for audit logs.

## Open Questions
- Do we want to surface alert history outside the modal (e.g., `/alerts`) to let users filter beyond the 4 most recent entries?
- Should paused alerts still count toward pricing metrics, or do we hide them until reactivated?
