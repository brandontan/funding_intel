# Funding Intelligence Mission

## Vision
Deliver a frictionless Web3 funding-rate intelligence hub that translates raw exchange data into actionable, capital-adjusted opportunities so semi-pro traders can capture reliable yield without spreadsheets or ad-hoc scripts.

## Target Users
- Semi-pro crypto traders who already hedge but lack unified tooling.
- Boutique prop desks and market makers that want quick reads on cash-and-carry trades.
- Crypto treasuries or DAOs seeking lower-risk yield signals before committing engineering time.

## Value Proposition
- Surface the most profitable, risk-adjusted funding opportunities across Binance, Bybit, and OKX with read-only safety by default.
- Provide instant capital-aware profit projections that reflect volatility, persistence, and exchange reliability.
- Offer alerting and onboarding flows that get traders from zero to monitoring in minutes, enabling a $99–$299/mo presell story.

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- 10 beta users checking funding dashboards weekly.
- 3 preorders at $99–$299/mo before auto-execution exists.
- Alert delivery latency under 60 seconds for WhatsApp/email in pilot tests.

## Principles
1. **Frictionless first**: everything read-only until users opt into automations.
2. **Show ROI quickly**: highlight concrete “$37.80/8h on $10K” style stats everywhere.
3. **Explain risk as clearly as yield**: trust badges, persistence scores, and fee callouts near every number.
4. **Plan for automation, ship intelligence now**: architecture keeps room for future auto-execution but MVP optimizes analysis + alerts.
