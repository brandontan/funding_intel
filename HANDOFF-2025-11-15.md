# Handoff – 2025-11-15

## Summary
- Finished Task 3 foundation: onboarding modal collects capital/leverage/exchange prefs + alert opt-ins and persists to Supabase via service-role API.
- Dashboard hero, tiles, and calculator now read the saved defaults (cookie-linked user_id), prioritizing preferred exchanges and respecting leverage.
- Task 4 drawer shipped: opportunity table launches a detailed drawer with persistence sparkline, risk stats, fee breakdown, hedging checklist, and quick actions (alert event hook, copy order, Telegram share). Drawer data comes from the new `/api/opportunity-detail` endpoint backed by Supabase history, and Alert Composer now listens for global open events.

## Next Steps
1. Hook opportunity drawer data into alert CRUD defaults (pre-fill thresholds from latest rates, show next funding countdown).
2. Move to Task 5: alert processing service + Telegram delivery stub (SendGrid/Telegram creds once available).
3. Keep following takeover checklist each session (Start Here, secret scan, MCP + handoff updates, commit/push, cleanup).

## Open Questions
- Still need Telegram bot + SendGrid creds timeline (currently mocked).
- Determine Auditor + spec-kit automation hook once alerts + drawers stabilize.

## Hand-off Owner
- Prepared by takeover agent on 2025-11-15.
