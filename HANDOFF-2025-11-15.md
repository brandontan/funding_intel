# Handoff – 2025-11-15

## Summary
- Codex-OS scaffolding plus MVP spec already in `.codex-os/`.
- Added Start Here guidance inside `AGENTS.md` per takeover checklist.
- Initialized git repo, ran gitleaks (clean), persisted MCP note.

## Next Steps
1. Implement spec Task 1 (Supabase schema + fetchers) with mock data if needed.
2. Set up Next.js app + package tooling (Task 2 prep).
3. Follow takeover checklist each session (Start Here, secret scan, handoff update, commit/push, cleanup).

## Open Questions
- Need confirmation on Twilio/SendGrid creds timeline (mock for now).
- Determine Auditor + spec-kit workflow integration points once codebase grows.

## Hand-off Owner
- Prepared by takeover agent on 2025-11-15.
