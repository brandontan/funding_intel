# Handoff – 2025-11-15

## Summary
- Finished Task 3 foundation earlier: onboarding modal collects capital/leverage/exchange prefs + alert opt-ins and persists to Supabase via service-role API.
- Dashboard hero, tiles, and calculator now read the saved defaults (cookie-linked user_id), prioritizing preferred exchanges and respecting leverage.
- Task 4 drawer shipped: opportunity table launches a detailed drawer with persistence sparkline, risk stats, fee breakdown, hedging checklist, and quick actions (alert event hook, copy order, Telegram share) plus countdown + recommended thresholds wired into the Alert Composer event bus.
- Task 5 groundwork landed: Supabase now tracks `alert_events`, `/api/opportunity-detail` recommends thresholds, Alert Composer auto-prefills values, and `fetchers/alerts_worker.mjs` polls opportunities then stubs email/Telegram delivery while logging to `alert_events`.

## Next Steps
1. Parameterize alert worker with real SendGrid/Telegram creds once available; extend it to respect per-user contact info (needs onboarding inputs + non-null user IDs).
2. Flesh out alert CRUD UI (list + edit) plus delivery status surface using the new `alert_events` table.
3. Keep following takeover checklist each session (Start Here, secret scan, MCP + handoff updates, commit/push, cleanup).

## Open Questions
- Still need Telegram bot + SendGrid creds timeline (currently mocked).
- Determine Auditor + spec-kit automation hook once alerts + drawers stabilize.

## Hand-off Owner
- Prepared by takeover agent on 2025-11-15.
