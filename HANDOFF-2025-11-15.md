# Handoff – 2025-11-15

## Summary
- Tasks 3–5 still hold from earlier in the day (settings storage, drawer UX, alert worker skeleton). Supabase currently has 191 funding rows and 23 opportunities seeded from HTX/Bitget/Gate/dYdX/OKX runs.
- Built richer analytics (exchange yield, capital efficiency, persistence trend, volatility vs trust); branch version proved it out but was reverted to keep `main` clean until Binance/Bybit data can flow reliably.
- Spent several hours trying to proxy Binance/Bybit. Cloudflare Worker approach fails because Binance blocks Cloudflare egress. Provisioned a São Paulo VPS (216.238.116.7) with Squid + a Node proxy script, but didn’t launch it yet—waiting to align on deployment strategy.

## Next Steps
1. Decide on proxy approach (run the provided Node proxy on the São Paulo VPS or finish Cloudflare Tunnel) so Binance/Bybit funding resumes. Once reachable, set `BINANCE_PROXY_URL`, `BYBIT_PROXY_URL`, rerun `npm run ingest`, and refresh analytics.
2. Reapply the enhanced analytics component once full data is flowing, then land Task 6 heatmap/mobile polish formally.
3. Resume Task 5 alert work: collect user contact info, wire the worker to real SendGrid/Telegram creds, and surface alert delivery history in the UI.
4. Keep following takeover checklist each session (Start Here, secret scan, MCP + handoff updates, commit/push, cleanup).

## Open Questions
- Need a final decision on proxy architecture: Cloudflare Tunnel vs. direct Node proxy on the São Paulo VPS. Once chosen, I can finish the setup immediately.
- Still waiting on Telegram bot + SendGrid credentials (alert worker currently stubbed).

## Hand-off Owner
- Prepared by takeover agent on 2025-11-15.
