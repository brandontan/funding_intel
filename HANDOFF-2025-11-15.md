# Handoff – 2025-11-15

## Summary
- Finished Task 3 foundation: onboarding modal collects capital/leverage/exchange prefs + alert opt-ins and persists to Supabase via service-role API.
- Dashboard hero, tiles, and calculator now read the saved defaults (cookie-linked user_id), prioritizing preferred exchanges and respecting leverage.
- Alert Composer defaults to the stored channel (Email or Telegram); migrations updated `user_settings` + `alert_channel` enums; gitleaks rerun after scrubbing `.next` artifacts and proxy secrets.

## Next Steps
1. Extend onboarding data into opportunity drawer + alerts CRUD contexts (pre-fill thresholds + recap settings).
2. Build Task 4 drawer UI (risk charts, action buttons) fed by Supabase opportunities + risk scoring job.
3. Keep following takeover checklist each session (Start Here, secret scan, MCP + handoff updates, commit/push, cleanup).

## Open Questions
- Still need Telegram bot + SendGrid creds timeline (currently mocked).
- Determine Auditor + spec-kit automation hook once alerts + drawers stabilize.

## Hand-off Owner
- Prepared by takeover agent on 2025-11-15.
